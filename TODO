Possible improvements:

1. Fixpoint iteration: In order to handle latex, waitless can be told do iterate
   the computation until it converges.  Normally this process would never
   converge due to timestamps, but we can solve that by freezing timestamps at
   the beginning of the fixpoint iteration processes.

2. Better symlink support.  Currently we ignore symlinks, which means that for
   reading symlinks are equivalent to copies of files.  Unfortunately, it also
   means that waitless will break if the same file is written simultaneously
   through different symlinks.  This is similar to the problem of untracked
   processes, and could possibly be handled with the same means.
