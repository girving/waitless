Possible improvements:

1. Fixpoint iteration: In order to handle latex, waitless can be told do iterate
   the computation until it converges.  Normally this process would never
   converge due to timestamps, but we can solve that by freezing timestamps at
   the beginning of the fixpoint iteration processes.
